 Part A: Corporate Default Prediction
📖 Problem Statement
Businesses risk default if they fail to meet debt obligations. Defaulting leads to lower credit ratings, higher interest rates, and reduced borrowing capacity. Investors need to identify financially stable companies before making investment decisions.

A company’s balance sheet provides crucial insights into its financial health, detailing assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity. Using machine learning, we predict a company's likelihood of default based on its financial statements.

🛠 Methodology
Used Logistic Regression as the predictive model.
Split the dataset into 67% training and 33% testing (random_state=42).
Evaluated performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores.
📊 Key Findings
The Logistic Regression model with an optimal threshold of 0.1076 showed:
84% accuracy on training data.
83.5% accuracy on test data.
Stable and consistent predictions across both datasets.
Precision and recall values for default and non-default cases were balanced, making the model reliable.
📌 Recommendations
✔ Collect more data on default cases to improve prediction accuracy.
✔ Feature engineering could help enhance model performance.
✔ Ensemble methods (Boosting/Bagging) can be explored to improve default identification.

📈 Part B: Market Risk Analysis
📖 Problem Statement
This project analyzes 6 years of weekly stock data from 10 Indian companies to measure market risk using mean and standard deviation of stock returns. The objective is to gain insights into investment opportunities and risk factors.

🛠 Methodology
Calculated mean returns and standard deviation for each stock.
Identified high and low-risk stocks based on their return volatility.
Used Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data analysis and visualization.
📊 Key Findings
Infosys & Shree Cement had the highest mean returns, making them potential investment opportunities.
Idea Vodafone & Jet Airways had the lowest mean returns, suggesting higher risk for investors.
📌 Recommendations
✔ Investors seeking higher profits should consider Infosys & Shree Cement.
✔ Investors preferring lower risk should be cautious with Idea Vodafone & Jet Airways.
✔ Holding investments long-term can help ride out market volatility.
✔ Regularly monitor market trends to make informed investment decisions.
